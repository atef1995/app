# ⏰ Customizable Study Reminder System

## ✅ What's Been Implemented

### 1. **User Settings Page** (`/settings`)
- ✅ Reminder time picker in Learning tab
- ✅ Shows user's local timezone automatically
- ✅ Saves to database properly
- ✅ All notification preferences working

### 2. **Smart Cron Job System**
- ✅ Runs every 30 minutes (instead of once daily)
- ✅ Respects individual user reminder times
- ✅ Only sends to users within ±30min window of their set time
- ✅ Includes personalized progress content
- ✅ Respects user notification preferences

### 3. **Database Schema**
- ✅ `UserSettings.reminderTime` field (format: "HH:MM")
- ✅ `UserSettings.timezone` field for future timezone support
- ✅ All notification preference flags

### 4. **Admin Monitoring**
- ✅ Cron job status dashboard
- ✅ Real-time execution monitoring
- ✅ Success/failure tracking
- ✅ Time-based filtering statistics

## 🚀 How It Works

### **User Experience:**
1. User goes to `/settings` → Learning tab
2. Sets their preferred reminder time (e.g., "19:30")
3. System shows their local timezone for clarity
4. Saves settings to database

### **Automated System:**
1. Cron job runs every 30 minutes
2. Calculates current time ±30min window
3. Finds users with reminder time in that window
4. Checks if they've been inactive for 3+ days
5. Gets their actual incomplete progress
6. Sends personalized email with next steps

### **Email Content Includes:**
- User's current incomplete tutorials
- Next recommended challenges
- Learning streak information
- Personalized based on mood (CHILL/RUSH/GRIND)
- Direct links to continue their progress

## 📋 Setup Instructions

### 1. **Configure Environment Variables**
Add to your `.env.local`:
```env
CRON_SECRET_TOKEN="your-secure-random-token-here"
SMTP_HOST="smtp.gmail.com"
SMTP_PORT="587"
SMTP_USER="your-email@gmail.com"
SMTP_PASS="your-16-char-app-password"
SMTP_FROM="Vibed to Cracked <your-email@gmail.com>"
```

### 2. **Set Up Windows Task Scheduler**
```bash
# Run as Administrator
scripts\setup-cron.bat
```

This creates a task that runs every 30 minutes.

### 3. **Test the System**
```bash
# Test mode (no emails sent)
node scripts/cron-study-reminders.js --test

# Full run (sends emails)
node scripts/cron-study-reminders.js
```

### 4. **Monitor via Admin Dashboard**
- Visit `/admin` (requires ADMIN role)
- Go to "Cron Jobs" tab
- View real-time statistics and execution history

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### **As a User:**
1. Visit `/settings`
2. Go to Learning tab
3. Set reminder time to current time ±30 minutes
4. Enable "Learning Reminders" in Notifications tab
5. Wait for next 30-minute interval

### **As an Admin:**
1. Visit `/admin` → Dashboard tab to see user stats
2. Go to Cron Jobs tab to monitor executions
3. Use "Test Run" button to see what would happen
4. Check execution logs for detailed results

### **Manual Testing:**
```bash
# Check what users would receive reminders now
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/cron/study-reminders?test=true"

# Check cron job status (requires admin login)
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/cron/status"
```

## 📊 System Architecture

### **Time Window Logic:**
- Cron runs every 30 minutes
- Current time: 14:30
- Looks for users with reminder time: 14:00 - 15:00
- This ensures each user gets reminded once per day at their chosen time

### **User Filtering:**
1. ✅ Has reminder notifications enabled
2. ✅ Reminder time within current window
3. ✅ Inactive for 3+ days (no progress updates)
4. ✅ Has incomplete tutorials/challenges

### **Database Queries:**
- Efficiently finds inactive users with time-based filtering
- Includes user's actual progress data
- Calculates learning streaks and next steps
- Respects all user preferences

## 🎯 Key Features

### **Smart Personalization:**
- ✅ Actual incomplete content (not generic reminders)
- ✅ Next tutorial/challenge recommendations
- ✅ Learning streak preservation
- ✅ Mood-based content adaptation

### **Time Accuracy:**
- ✅ Respects user's chosen time
- ✅ Timezone-aware display
- ✅ 30-minute window for reliability
- ✅ Once-per-day delivery guarantee

### **Admin Control:**
- ✅ Real-time monitoring
- ✅ Success/failure tracking
- ✅ Manual testing capabilities
- ✅ User statistics dashboard

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues:**

1. **No emails being sent:**
   - Check SMTP configuration
   - Verify users have reminder notifications enabled
   - Ensure users have been inactive for 3+ days
   - Check if current time matches any user reminder times

2. **Wrong timing:**
   - Verify cron job is running every 30 minutes
   - Check server timezone vs user timezone
   - Look at admin dashboard for execution logs

3. **Database errors:**
   - Run: `npx prisma generate`
   - Ensure UserSettings table exists
   - Check user has settings record

### **Debug Commands:**
```bash
# Check database connection
npx prisma studio

# Test email configuration
node scripts/cron-study-reminders.js --test

# View logs
# Check Task Scheduler for execution history
```
