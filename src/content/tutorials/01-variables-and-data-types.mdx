# JavaScript Basics: Variables and Data Types

Welcome to your first JavaScript tutorial! üéâ In this lesson, we'll explore the foundation of JavaScript programming: variables and data types.

## What are Variables?

Variables are containers that store data values. Think of them as labeled boxes where you can put different types of information.

<InteractiveCodeBlock title="Try Your First Variables" description="Run this code to see how variables work:">
{`let message = "Hello, World!";
let age = 25;
let isLearning = true;

console.log(message); console.log("Age:", age); console.log("Learning JavaScript:", isLearning);`}

</InteractiveCodeBlock>

## Variable Declarations

JavaScript has three ways to declare variables:

### 1. `let` - Modern and Flexible

<InteractiveCodeBlock title="Experimenting with let" description="Try changing the userName value:">
{`let userName = "Alex";
console.log("Original name:", userName);

userName = "Sam"; // Can be reassigned console.log("New name:", userName);`}

</InteractiveCodeBlock>

**Use `let` when:**

- The value might change later
- You need **block-level scope** _(variables only exist within the nearest `{}` braces)_

### 2. `const` - Constants

<InteractiveCodeBlock title="Working with const" description="See what happens with constants:">
const pi = 3.14159;
const siteName = "Vibed to Cracked";

console.log("Pi:", pi);

console.log("Site:", siteName);

// Try uncommenting the next line to see the error:

// pi = 3.14; // ‚ùå Error! Cannot reassign

</InteractiveCodeBlock>

**Use `const` when:**

- The value should never change
- For objects and arrays _(content can change, reference cannot - this is called **immutability of reference**)_

### 3. `var` - Legacy (Avoid in Modern JavaScript)

```javascript
var oldStyle = "Don't use this anymore";
```

**Why avoid `var`:**

- **Function-scoped** _(exists throughout the entire function, not just the block where it's defined)_
- **Hoisting issues** _(variables are "lifted" to the top of their scope, which can cause unexpected behavior)_
- No block scope _(can leak out of `if` statements, loops, etc.)_

> **üí° What is Hoisting?** Hoisting is JavaScript's behavior of moving variable and function declarations to the top of their containing scope during compilation. This means you can use a variable before you declare it, but it will be `undefined` until the assignment line is reached.
>
> ```javascript
> console.log(mystery); // undefined (not an error!)
> var mystery = "I'm hoisted!";
> ```
>
> With `let` and `const`, you get a **Temporal Dead Zone** - trying to access them before declaration throws an error, which is much safer!

## Data Types in JavaScript

JavaScript has several built-in data types. Understanding **data types** is crucial because they determine what operations you can perform on your data.

> **üí° Dynamic Typing** JavaScript is **dynamically typed**, meaning you don't need to specify the type when creating a variable. The type is determined automatically based on the value you assign. This is different from **statically typed** languages like Java or C++ where you must declare the type explicitly.

### Primitive Types

**Primitive types** are the most basic data types in JavaScript. They are immutable (cannot be changed) and stored by value.

#### 1. Number

JavaScript uses **IEEE 754 double-precision floating-point** format for all numbers. This means there's only one number type (unlike languages with int, float, double, etc.).

<InteractiveCodeBlock title="Working with Numbers" description="JavaScript handles all numbers as the same type:">
let age = 25;
let price = 19.99;
let negative = -10;

console.log("Age:", age); console.log("Price:", price); console.log("Negative:", negative);

// Try some math operations

console.log("Age + 5:", age + 5); console.log("Price _ 2:", price _ 2);

</InteractiveCodeBlock>

#### 2. String

Strings represent text data. JavaScript strings are **UTF-16 encoded** and **immutable** (creating a new string when modified).

> **üí° Template Literals** The backtick syntax (\`\`) allows **template literals** with embedded expressions using `${expression}`. This is much cleaner than string concatenation with `+` operators.

<InteractiveCodeBlock title="String Manipulation" description="Explore different ways to work with text:">
let firstName = "John";
let lastName = "Doe";
let fullName = `${firstName} ${lastName}`; // Template literal

console.log("First name:", firstName); console.log("Last name:", lastName); console.log("Full name:", fullName);

// String methods console.log("Length:", fullName.length);

console.log("Uppercase:", fullName.toUpperCase());

</InteractiveCodeBlock>

#### 3. Boolean

Booleans represent logical values and are fundamental to **conditional logic** and **control flow**. Named after mathematician George Boole.

> **üí° Truthy and Falsy** In JavaScript, values can be **truthy** or **falsy** when evaluated in a boolean context. Falsy values include: `false`, `0`, `""`, `null`, `undefined`, and `NaN`. Everything else is truthy!

<InteractiveCodeBlock title="Boolean Logic" description="True or false - the foundation of programming logic:">
let isActive = true;
let isComplete = false;

console.log("Is active:", isActive); console.log("Is complete:", isComplete);

// Boolean operations console.log("Both true:", isActive && isComplete);

console.log("At least one true:", isActive || isComplete);

console.log("Not active:", !isActive);

</InteractiveCodeBlock>

#### 4. Undefined

`undefined` means a variable has been declared but not assigned a value. It's JavaScript's way of saying "I don't know what this is yet."

> **üí° Undefined vs ReferenceError** > `undefined` means the variable exists but has no value. A **ReferenceError** means the variable doesn't exist at all in the current scope.

<InteractiveCodeBlock
  title="Understanding Undefined"
  description="Variables without values:"
>
  let notAssigned; 
  console.log("Not assigned:", notAssigned);
  console.log("Type:", typeof notAssigned);
</InteractiveCodeBlock>

#### 5. Null

`null` represents an intentional absence of value. It's a **primitive value** that represents "nothing" or "empty" on purpose.

> **üí° The `typeof null` Quirk** > `typeof null` returns `"object"` instead of `"null"`. This is a famous bug in JavaScript that can't be fixed without breaking existing code. It's been around since JavaScript's creation in 1995!

<InteractiveCodeBlock
  title="Null Values"
  description="Intentionally empty values:"
>
  // Intentionally empty 
  let emptyValue = null; 
  
  console.log("Empty value:", emptyValue); // Quirk: shows 'object' 
  
  console.log("Type:", typeof emptyValue);
</InteractiveCodeBlock>

### Checking Data Types

Use the `typeof` **operator** (not a function!) to determine a variable's type at runtime. This is called **runtime type checking**.

> **üí° Operator vs Function** > `typeof` is an **operator** like `+` or `-`, not a function. That's why you write `typeof variable` instead of `typeof(variable)` (though parentheses work too).

```javascript
console.log(typeof 42); // "number"
console.log(typeof "Hello"); // "string"
console.log(typeof true); // "boolean"
console.log(typeof undefined); // "undefined"
console.log(typeof null); // "object" (this is a known quirk!)
```

## Best Practices

Following these conventions will make your code more **maintainable**, **readable**, and **debuggable**.

### 1. Use Descriptive Names

Variable names should be **self-documenting** - anyone reading your code should understand what the variable contains without additional comments.

> **üí° Naming Conventions** JavaScript uses **camelCase** for variables and functions. The first letter is lowercase, and each subsequent word starts with uppercase. This improves **code readability** and follows community standards.

```javascript
// ‚ùå Bad
let x = 25;
let data = "John";

// ‚úÖ Good
let userAge = 25;
let firstName = "John";
```

### 2. Use `const` by Default

This is called **"const by default"** - a defensive programming practice that prevents accidental reassignment and makes your intentions clear.

> **üí° Immutability** Using `const` doesn't make objects or arrays immutable - it just prevents reassigning the variable to a different object/array. The contents can still change. For true immutability, you'd need `Object.freeze()` or libraries like Immutable.js.

```javascript
// ‚úÖ Start with const
const userName = "Alex";
const userPreferences = { theme: "dark" };

// ‚úÖ Use let only when you need to reassign
let currentPage = 1;
currentPage = 2; // This is why we need let
```

### 3. Initialize Variables

**Initialization** means giving a variable a value when you declare it. This prevents **undefined behavior** and makes your code more predictable.

> **üí° Defensive Programming** Initializing variables is a **defensive programming** technique that helps prevent bugs. When variables have known initial values, it's easier to debug and reason about your code's behavior.

```javascript
// ‚ùå Avoid
let score;
// ... lots of code ...
score = 100; // Easy to forget!

// ‚úÖ Better
let score = 0;
```

## Interactive Example

Try this in your browser's console:

```javascript
// Create variables for a simple user profile
const username = "coder123";
let points = 0;
let level = "beginner";
let isOnline = true;

// Update the user's progress
points = points + 50;
level = "intermediate";

console.log(`User: ${username}`);
console.log(`Points: ${points}`);
console.log(`Level: ${level}`);
console.log(`Online: ${isOnline}`);
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

These are **runtime errors** and **logic errors** that beginners often encounter. Understanding them will save you debugging time!

### 1. Reassigning `const`

This throws a **TypeError** at runtime. The JavaScript engine prevents you from changing const variables to maintain **program integrity**.

```javascript
const score = 100;
score = 200; // ‚ùå TypeError: Assignment to constant variable
```

### 2. Using Variables Before Declaration

With `let` and `const`, accessing variables before declaration creates a **Temporal Dead Zone** - the variable exists but cannot be accessed, throwing a **ReferenceError**.

> **üí° Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)** The **TDZ** is the time between when a variable enters scope and when it's declared. During this time, the variable exists but accessing it throws an error. This is a safety feature that prevents the confusing behavior of `var` hoisting.

```javascript
console.log(myVar); // ‚ùå ReferenceError
let myVar = "Hello";
```

### 3. Confusing `null` and `undefined`

Understanding the difference helps with **semantic clarity** - your code communicates intent better when you use the right one.

> **üí° Semantic Meaning**
>
> - `undefined`: "I don't know what this should be yet" (unintentional absence)
> - `null`: "This should be empty right now" (intentional absence)
>
> Many style guides recommend using `null` for intentionally empty values and letting JavaScript use `undefined` for uninitialized variables.

```javascript
let uninitialized; // undefined (not set)
let intentionallyEmpty = null; // null (intentionally empty)
```

## Your Turn! üí™

Practice with these exercises:

1. Create a `const` variable for your favorite programming language
2. Create a `let` variable for your current mood
3. Use template literals to create a sentence combining both
4. Check the `typeof` each variable

```javascript
// Your code here:
const favLanguage = "JavaScript";
let currentMood = "excited";
let sentence = `I'm ${currentMood} about learning ${favLanguage}!`;

console.log(sentence);
console.log(typeof favLanguage);
console.log(typeof currentMood);
```
