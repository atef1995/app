# Node.js Fundamentals: Your First Server-Side Journey

Welcome to the world of Node.js! 🚀 Ready to take your JavaScript skills beyond the browser?

You know how you've been writing JavaScript that runs in web browsers? Well, imagine if you could use that same JavaScript knowledge to build servers, create command-line tools, and handle files on your computer. That's exactly what Node.js lets you do!

## What is Node.js, Really?

Think of Node.js like this: You know how your favorite video game can run on different gaming consoles? JavaScript used to only "run" in browsers, but Node.js is like a new gaming console that lets JavaScript run directly on your computer, outside of any browser!

**Student:** "Wait, so Node.js isn't a programming language?"

**Teacher:** "Exactly! Node.js is what we call a *runtime environment*. It's like the stage where JavaScript performs, but instead of performing in a browser, it performs directly on your computer. You're still writing JavaScript - just with some awesome new superpowers!"

Let's start with the classic "Hello, World!" but this time, it's running on your computer, not in a browser:

<InteractiveCodeBlock language="nodejs" title="Your First Node.js Program" description="This JavaScript is running in a real Node.js environment!">
{`console.log("Hello from Node.js!");
console.log("I'm running on the server side now!");

// Let's see what version of Node.js we're using
console.log("Node.js version info:", process.version);
console.log("Platform:", process.platform);
console.log("Current working directory:", process.cwd());`}
</InteractiveCodeBlock>

**Did you notice something cool?** We used `process.version` - that's a Node.js-specific feature that doesn't exist in browsers. The `process` object is like Node.js's way of saying "Hey, here's some info about the environment I'm running in!"

## The Superpowers Node.js Gives You

When JavaScript runs in Node.js instead of a browser, it gains some incredible abilities:

### 1. File System Access - Reading and Writing Files

In a browser, JavaScript can't directly access files on your computer (for security reasons). But with Node.js, you can read, write, and manipulate files! It's like giving JavaScript a key to your computer's filing cabinet.

<InteractiveCodeBlock language="nodejs" title="Working with Files" description="Let's create and read a file:">
{`const fs = require('fs');

// Create a simple text file
const message = "Hello from Node.js! This is my first file.";
fs.writeFileSync('hello.txt', message);

console.log("File created! Now let's read it back:");

// Read the file we just created
const fileContent = fs.readFileSync('hello.txt', 'utf8');
console.log("File contains:", fileContent);

// Let's also check if the file exists
const fileExists = fs.existsSync('hello.txt');
console.log("Does the file exist?", fileExists);`}
</InteractiveCodeBlock>

**Mind-blowing, right?** We just created a file, wrote some text to it, and then read it back! Try changing the message and running it again.

**Student:** "This is cool, but what's that `require('fs')` thing?"

**Teacher:** "Great question! That's Node.js's way of importing built-in modules. `fs` stands for 'file system' - it's like a toolbox full of file-related functions that Node.js gives us for free!"

### 2. Built-in Modules - Your Swiss Army Knife

Node.js comes with tons of built-in modules (think of them as pre-built tool kits). Let's explore a few:

<InteractiveCodeBlock language="nodejs" title="Exploring Built-in Modules" description="Let's use some of Node.js's built-in superpowers:">
{`// Operating System information
const os = require('os');
console.log("Your computer's platform:", os.platform());
console.log("Available memory:", Math.round(os.freemem() / 1024 / 1024), "MB");

// Path utilities (super helpful for file paths!)
const path = require('path');
const filePath = '/users/documents/myfile.txt';
console.log("File name:", path.basename(filePath));
console.log("Directory:", path.dirname(filePath));
console.log("File extension:", path.extname(filePath));

// URL utilities
const url = require('url');
const myURL = new URL('https://example.com/path?name=value');
console.log("URL hostname:", myURL.hostname);
console.log("URL pathname:", myURL.pathname);`}
</InteractiveCodeBlock>

**Pretty powerful stuff!** These modules are like having a toolshed full of specialized tools, each designed for specific tasks.

### 3. Working with JSON - The Internet's Language

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is like the universal language of the internet. Node.js makes it super easy to work with JSON data:

<InteractiveCodeBlock title="JSON Magic" description="Let's work with some JSON data:">
{`// Create a JavaScript object
const student = {
    name: "Alex",
    age: 20,
    courses: ["JavaScript", "Node.js", "React"],
    isActive: true
};

console.log("Original object:", student);

// Convert to JSON string (like packing it for shipping)
const jsonString = JSON.stringify(student, null, 2);
console.log("As JSON string:");
console.log(jsonString);

// Convert back to JavaScript object (unpacking)
const parsedObject = JSON.parse(jsonString);
console.log("Parsed back to object:", parsedObject);
console.log("Student's first course:", parsedObject.courses[0]);`}
</InteractiveCodeBlock>

**Student:** "Why would I want to convert objects to strings and back?"

**Teacher:** "Excellent question! When you want to save data to a file, send it over the internet, or store it in a database, you need to convert it to a format that can be easily transmitted or stored. JSON is perfect for this - it's like a universal packing format for data!"

## Understanding the Event Loop (The Heart of Node.js)

Here's something really cool about Node.js - it's designed to handle multiple things at once without getting stuck. Let's see this in action:

<InteractiveCodeBlock language="nodejs" title="Asynchronous Magic" description="Watch how Node.js handles multiple tasks:">
{`console.log("🚀 Starting our async adventure!");

// This will happen immediately
console.log("1. This happens first");

// This will wait 2 seconds, but won't block other code
setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("3. This happens after 2 seconds");
}, 2000);

// This will wait 1 second
setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("2. This happens after 1 second");
}, 1000);

// This happens immediately, even though we wrote it after the timeouts
console.log("4. This happens immediately, but I'm last in the code!");

console.log("🎯 All timeouts are set up! Now we wait...");`}
</InteractiveCodeBlock>

**Did you see what happened?** The code didn't stop and wait for the timeouts - it kept running! This is called **asynchronous programming**, and it's one of Node.js's superpowers. It's like being able to start cooking pasta, then while the water is boiling, you can chop vegetables, make sauce, and set the table - all without standing around waiting!

## Your First Practical Node.js Script

Let's combine what we've learned to create something useful - a simple file organizer:

<InteractiveCodeBlock language="nodejs" title="File Organizer Script" description="Let's build a practical tool:">
{`const fs = require('fs');
  const path = require('path');

  // Function to create a log entry
  function createLogEntry(message) {
    const timestamp = new Date().toISOString();
    return "[" + timestamp + "] " + message + "\\n";
  }

  // Simulate organizing files with async/await
  const activities = [
    "Scanning current directory...",
    "Found 5 JavaScript files",
    "Found 3 text files",
    "Found 2 image files",
    "Creating organized folder structure...",
    "Moving JavaScript files to /js folder",
    "Moving text files to /docs folder",
    "Moving images to /images folder",
    "Organization complete!"
  ];

  async function delay(ms) {
    return new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, ms));
  }

  async function organizeFiles() {
    let logContent = createLogEntry("=== File Organization Started ===");

    for (let i = 0; i < activities.length; i++) {
      const activity = activities[i];
      await delay(200); // Wait 200ms between activities

      console.log(activity);
      logContent += createLogEntry(activity);
    }

    // Save the log file
    await delay(100);
    fs.writeFileSync('organization-log.txt', logContent);
    console.log("📋 Log saved to 'organization-log.txt'");

    // Read and display the log
    const savedLog = fs.readFileSync('organization-log.txt', 'utf8');
    console.log("📖 Log contents:");
    console.log(savedLog);
  }

  // Run the organization
  organizeFiles().catch(console.error);`}
</InteractiveCodeBlock>

**Wow! Look at that!** We just built a script that simulates organizing files and creates a log of its activities. This is the kind of practical automation you can build with Node.js!

## What Makes Node.js Different from Browser JavaScript?

Let's clarify some key differences:

**Browser JavaScript:**
- Runs in a sandbox (limited access to your computer)
- Has access to DOM (web page elements)
- Can't directly access files or run system commands
- Great for interactive websites

**Node.js JavaScript:**
- Runs directly on your computer
- Can access files, networks, and system resources
- No DOM (no web page elements)
- Perfect for servers, tools, and desktop applications

<InteractiveCodeBlock language="nodejs" title="Node.js vs Browser Features" description="Let's explore what's available in Node.js:">
{`// Things that exist in Node.js but NOT in browsers:
console.log("=== Node.js Exclusive Features ===");
console.log("Current working directory:", process.cwd());
console.log("Command line arguments:", process.argv.slice(2));
console.log("Environment variables available:", Object.keys(process.env).length);

// The global object in Node.js
console.log("\\n=== Global Object ===");
console.log("In Node.js, the global object is called 'global'");
console.log("Type of global:", typeof global);

// Module system
console.log("\\n=== Module System ===");
console.log("Current module filename:", __filename || "Not available in this environment");
console.log("Current module directory:", __dirname || "Not available in this environment");

// Note: In browsers, you'd have 'window' object and DOM methods
// But in Node.js, there's no 'window' or 'document'
console.log("\\n=== What's NOT Available ===");
console.log("'window' object exists?", typeof window !== 'undefined');
console.log("'document' object exists?", typeof document !== 'undefined');`}
</InteractiveCodeBlock>

## Quick Practice Challenge

Before we wrap up, let's put your new Node.js knowledge to the test:

<InteractiveCodeBlock language="nodejs" title="Practice Challenge: Personal Info Tool" description="Complete this Node.js script:">
{`// Your mission: Create a simple personal information manager
const fs = require('fs');

// 1. Create an object with your information
const myInfo = {
    name: "Your Name Here",
    age: 25,
    hobbies: ["coding", "reading", "gaming"],
    favoriteLanguage: "JavaScript",
    learningGoals: ["Master Node.js", "Build awesome apps"]
};

// 2. Convert to JSON and save to file
const jsonData = JSON.stringify(myInfo, null, 2);
fs.writeFileSync('my-profile.json', jsonData);
console.log("✅ Profile saved!");

// 3. Read it back and display specific info
const profile = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync('my-profile.json', 'utf8'));
console.log(\`👋 Hi, I'm \${profile.name}!\`);
console.log(\`🎯 My goal: \${profile.learningGoals[0]}\`);
console.log(\`🎮 My hobbies: \${profile.hobbies.join(", ")}\`);

// 4. Bonus: Add a timestamp
profile.lastUpdated = new Date().toISOString();
fs.writeFileSync('my-profile.json', JSON.stringify(profile, null, 2));
console.log("🕒 Profile updated with timestamp!");`}
</InteractiveCodeBlock>

**Try customizing the information with your own details!** This is a simple example of how Node.js can handle data persistence - saving information that survives between program runs.

## Bonus: Your First HTTP Server! 🌐

Want to see something really exciting? Let's create a simple web server with just a few lines of Node.js code:

<InteractiveCodeBlock language="nodejs" title="Create Your First Web Server" description="Build a real HTTP server that responds to requests:">
{`const http = require('http');

// Create a simple HTTP server
const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
    // Set response headers
    res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/html' });
    
    // Send HTML response
    res.end(\`
        <html>
            <head><title>My First Node.js Server</title></head>
            <body>
                <h1>🎉 Hello from Node.js Server!</h1>
                <p>You just built your first web server!</p>
                <p><strong>Request URL:</strong> \${req.url}</p>
                <p><strong>Method:</strong> \${req.method}</p>
                <p><strong>Time:</strong> \${new Date().toLocaleString()}</p>
            </body>
        </html>
    \`);
});

// Start the server on port 3000
const PORT = 3000;
server.listen(PORT, () => {
    console.log(\`🚀 Server is running at http://localhost:\${PORT}\`);
    console.log(\`📡 Try visiting the server in your browser!\`);
    console.log(\`🛑 Press Ctrl+C to stop the server\`);
});

// Keep the server running for 10 seconds for demo
setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("\\n⏰ Demo timeout - server stopping...");
    server.close(() => {
        console.log("✅ Server stopped gracefully");
    });
}, 10000);`}
</InteractiveCodeBlock>

**Mind-blown?** 🤯 You just created a real web server! In a production environment, this server would keep running and handle thousands of requests. This is the foundation of web applications, REST APIs, and microservices.

**Student:** "Wait, that's it? That's all it takes to create a web server?"

**Teacher:** "Exactly! That's the beauty of Node.js - complex tasks become simple. Companies use this same `http` module (often with frameworks like Express) to build entire web applications that serve millions of users!"
