## üêõ Known Issues & Workarounds

### Issue 1: GitHub API Rate Limit
**Problem**: Too many API calls exhaust rate limit
**Workaround**: Use authenticated requests with personal access token
**Solution**: Set `GITHUB_TOKEN` in environment variables

### Issue 2: Webhooks Not Working Locally
**Problem**: GitHub can't reach localhost
**Workaround**: Use ngrok or manual database updates
**Solution**: For testing, manually update submission status in Prisma Studio

### Issue 3: No Real CI/CD on Test Repo
**Problem**: Template repo doesn't have GitHub Actions
**Workaround**: System still works, just shows "pending" CI status
**Solution**: Add `.github/workflows/ci.yml` to template repo
