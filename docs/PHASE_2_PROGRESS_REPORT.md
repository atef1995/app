## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### Component Architecture

**PeerReviewInterface**:
- Client-side component with real-time state management
- Fetches PR diff on mount via API
- Validates feedback before submission
- Supports cancellation (returns to submission page)

**MergedPRCelebration**:
- Modal overlay component
- Triggered from Submission Detail page
- Uses localStorage to prevent duplicate celebrations
- Confetti effect runs for 3 seconds
- XP counter animates from 0 to earned amount

**Submission Detail Page**:
- Combines multiple data sources (submission, reviews, PR status)
- Conditional rendering based on user role (owner vs reviewer)
- Shows celebration modal for first-time merged PR view
- Review form replaces page content when reviewing

**Dashboard Page**:
- Tab-based content switching
- Responsive grid layout for stats
- List view for submissions and assignments
- Empty states with encouraging messaging

### API Integration

All components use consistent error handling:
```typescript
try {
  const response = await fetch(url);
  const data = await response.json();
  if (!data.success) throw new Error(data.error);
  // Handle success
} catch (err) {
  setError((err as Error).message);
}
```

### State Management

- React hooks (useState, useEffect)
- NextAuth session for authentication
- Local state for loading/error states
- No global state needed yet (may add Zustand/Redux later if needed)

## 🚀 What's Next (Phase 2 Completion)

### 1. Review Queue Page (High Priority)

**Purpose**: Central place for reviewers to see all assigned reviews

**Features Needed**:
- List of pending review assignments
- Filter by status (Pending / Completed)
- Sort by priority or deadline
- Quick access to start review
- Review assignment statistics

**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours

### 2. Peer Review Assignment Logic (High Priority)

**Purpose**: Automatically match reviewers to submissions

**Algorithm**:
- Match reviewers at same or higher skill level
- Avoid assigning to friends (to reduce bias)
- Balance review load across users
- Consider reviewer's recent activity

**Implementation**:
- Create `/api/contributions/assign-reviewers` endpoint
- Trigger on PR submission
- Store assignments in database
- Send notifications to assigned reviewers

**Estimated Time**: 3-4 hours

### 3. XP System Integration (Medium Priority)

**Purpose**: Reward students for contributions

**Features**:

- Award XP to reviewers for completed reviews (25 XP default)
- Update user XP total
- Trigger level-up notifications

**Implementation**:
- Create XP service or integrate with existing gamification system
- Update webhook handler to award XP on merge
- Update review submission to award reviewer XP

**Estimated Time**: 2 hours

### 4. Enhanced Webhook Integration (Medium Priority)

**Current**: Webhook updates submission status, sends notifications

**Enhancements Needed**:
- Trigger celebration immediately when PR is merged (push notification or real-time update)
- Auto-assign next review when one completes
- Update leaderboards in real-time

**Estimated Time**: 1-2 hours

### 5. Achievement System Integration (Low Priority)

**Purpose**: Unlock badges for milestones

**Achievements**:
- First PR merged
- 10 PRs merged
- 50 reviews given
- Perfect score (100%) on submission
- Week streak maintained

**Implementation**:
- Check achievement criteria on key events
- Create UserAchievement records
- Show badge in celebration modal
- Display on user profile

**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours

2. **Animation Polish**: canvas-confetti adds professional touch to celebration
3. **Weighted Rubric**: More accurate scoring than simple average
4. **User Experience**: Loading states, error handling, and empty states all implemented

### Areas for Improvement
1. **Real-time Updates**: Consider WebSockets for live PR status updates
2. **Caching**: Add React Query or SWR for better data caching
3. **Testing**: Add Jest tests for components (currently manual testing only)
4. **Performance**: Consider virtualization for long lists in dashboard
